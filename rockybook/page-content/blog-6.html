  <p>
    Teen Patti is a popular card game that originated in South Asia, similar to
    poker but simpler. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards
    (without jokers). A player receives three cards, and the goal is to have the
    best hand, following a set ranking of cards. The player must place bets,
    either playing “seen” (looking at their cards) or “blind” (without looking).
    The player or the dealer with the highest-ranking hand at the end wins the
    pot.
