  <p>How to become Dragon Tiger Master</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Establish a Budget: Before diving into betting, it's important to set a
      budget for your gaming activities. This will help you keep track of your
      finances and avoid overspending or putting too much of your money at risk.
    </li>
    <li>
      Grasping the rules of Dragon Tiger is crucial. Get to know the game
      mechanics, such as the various bets you can make and their corresponding
      odds. This understanding will help you make better choices when placing
      your bets.
    </li>
    <li>
      Focus on betting on Dragon or Tiger: It's best to stick with the main bets
      on Dragon or Tiger since they come with a lower house edge of about 3.73%.
      Steer clear of complicated side bets, as they typically involve greater
      risks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Avoid the Tie Bet: While the Tie bet may look attractive because of its
      high payout, it comes with a much higher house edge (around 32.77%). It's
      wise to avoid this bet in favor of better odds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Track Results, Look for Patterns: Although Dragon Tiger is primarily a
      game of chance, monitoring recent results can assist you in spotting
      trends. Pay attention to the outcomes to guide your future bets.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider implementing betting strategies such as the Martingale system,
      where you double your bet after a loss. Use these methods with caution and
      make sure you have enough funds to handle a potential losing streak.
    </li>
    <li>
      Start with Small Bets: If you're just starting out with Dragon Tiger, it's
      a good idea to place smaller bets. This way, you can get a feel for the
      game without putting a lot of money on the line.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stay calm and focused: Making decisions based on emotions can result in
      unwise betting choices. Keep a clear mind and steer clear of impulsive
      bets driven by feelings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Establish Win and Loss Limits: Before you begin playing, set a profit goal
      and a maximum loss threshold. If you hit either of these limits, it's time
      to stop. This approach helps you stay disciplined and manage your bankroll
      wisely.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make the Most of Casino Bonuses: Keep an eye out for promotional bonuses
      and offers from RockyBook. These can give you additional funds to play
      with, increasing your chances of winning.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    By following these steps, you can elevate your winning journey, sharpen your
    gaming skills and you can become Dragon Tiger Master. Now that you’ve
    grasped the strategies of the game, it’s time to put them into practice and
    enjoy your experience. Good Luck!
